# Inverse Kinematics
 Simple proof of concept program of an algorithm for inverse kinematics.

## How to use it
Left click to add a node.

Join two nodes by a string by holding left click and dragging the mouse from one node to another.

Left click on an existing node to fix it to the canvas. This will also allow you to move it by holding click and dragging it.

The algorithm will iteratively compute the position of all the free (white) nodes so that the red ones stick to the position you left them.
